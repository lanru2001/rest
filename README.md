# Restaurant project - backend
This is an SPA website for booking a table in an imagined vegan restanrant, using React as frontend and Node.js as backend. Foodies can simply browse the menu without login and they need to register as members if they want to make a reservation. On the other hand, admin can manage not only bookings from the customers but also content of the menu.

# Demo
[Demo](https://reactrestaurantfn.herokuapp.com/#/).

You may use the admin's login. Username: admin, password: admin12345678.

:bangbang: I would be really appreciate if you just delete the picture you uploaded when you want to edit menu. This is due to the fact that I need those already-exist pictures to be displayed in the menu page. Thank you in advance. :smiley:

Or simply create a new account by registration.

# About this project
This project is inspired by [one of my assignment](https://github.com/Lidemy/mentor-program-4th-Pei-wen-code/tree/master/homeworks/week6) when I was learning in a [coding mentorship programme](https://github.com/Lidemy/mentor-program-4th-Pei-wen-code) with Lidemy. That is a simple homepage of an imagined restaurant where only HTML and CSS are used. Having been learning React and Node.js, I decide to create a SPA website where customers can make reservation without spending time to call restaurants. On the other hand, restaurant owners can save time to look for the availability when customers phone in, meaning they will have more time to be creative in their cuisine.
